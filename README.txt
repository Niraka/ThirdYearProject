A third year university project to research and develop in an area of my choosing.

What:
This project is an exploration in to the requirements of developing a multiplayer
online role playing game (MORPG).

The project was always focused on the technical side of things but includes a brief
look at the gameplay elements involved as well.

Included content:
- Client and server software
- Game assets (music removed due to copyright)
- My 90-something page report



Why:
- I have a passion for online games
- Understanding the basics of networking is important for any developer



What did I take from this:
- Client side prediction/interpolation makes games playable
- Server databases
- Client-server networking with a UDP custom connection implementation is a good idea
- Multi-threading is great if you use it properly
- The ridiculous number of things that need to be done to build a client and server from scratch
- Developer tools are useful for speeding things up
